# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide high level summaries for Pewlett Hackard executives to strategically staff and backfill positions that will be opened after an expected period of thousands of retirements from the company. This analysis uses historic company human resources data to assess which departments and roles will need to be filled. To determine which employees have potential to retire in the near future, I selected those employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. In order to further help Pewlett Hackard smoothly transition to a newer, less experienced work force, I also created a list of current employees born in 1965 that may be able to provide mentorship to the next generation of employees.

* The table above shows the number of potentially retiring employees by their current title. As seen here, senior engineers will take the biggest hit in the coming years that will require the most attention to staffing. Additionally, 14,222 engineers will also be retiring. If Pewlett Hackard chooses to promote their internal talent pipeline of engineers to senior engineers, this will result in a newer, less experienced team of senior engineers, and the engineers hired to replace the retirees and the newly promoted will also be new.
* There are 28,254 senior staff members retiring - this will impact multiple departments on a large scale. Further analysis may be needed to identify which departments have the highest need of staffing for general staff roles. These roles may face a similar issue to the engineering team, as there are 12,243 general staff members retiring, so Pewlett Hackard may be promoting or hiring senior staff members that will oversee new staff members. 
* There are only 1,761 assistant engineers that will be retiring. This should leave a strong pool of current assistant engineers. Investing in the development and training of current assistant engineers to make them promotion to engineer ready may have high return, as 14,222 engineers will be retiring.
*  Based on the critera of being currently employed and born in the year 1965, the mentorship program only has 1550 eligible employees. That means that every potential mentor would have 15-20 pupils under their guidance. Clearly, the mentorship eligibility criteria must be expanded and rethought as the demand for mentors very strongly outpaces supply.

There are 41,380 employees that will be retiring in the coming "Silver Tsunami". Senior engineers (29,414 retiring) comprise the largest portion of this cohort, followed closely by senior staff (28,254 retiring). As these are all extremely technical roles, training and development should be at the forefront of decision making both for current employees who may be promoted to fill these senior roles, and for back filling these newly promoted positions. Marketing and recruiting efforts on college campuses, LinkedIn, and other job board sites should be immediately scaled up to begin filling assistant engineer positions, so that current assistant engineers can be promoted without leaving any positions empty. 
As of now, there are not currently enough qualified, retirement ready employees in the departments to mentor the next group of employees. This table provides a count of potential mentors by title.

There is a large disparity between the number of soon to be open senior engineer positions and the number of senior engineers available to mentor. There are almost 30,000 senior engineers retiring, and only 270 mentors available. This means that each mentor would have over 100 people to mentor each. If the mentor program is designed to be a part time job - that will prove to be a difficult proposition to get employees to participate in. Pewlett Hackard executives should explore the mentorship job differently - How many senior engineers can one mentor provide mentorship to? Working backwards to establish the desired number can allow the analytics team to change the mentor selection criteria and lead the program to success.
